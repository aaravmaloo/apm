# Using .apmignore

The `.apmignore` file controls what APM excludes from cloud upload payloads. It's processed **before** encryption and upload during `pm cloud sync`, allowing you to maintain local-only data while still syncing the rest of your vault.

---

## File Location

Place `.apmignore` in one of these locations (searched in order):

1. **Same directory as your vault file** (most common)
2. **Current working directory** when running `pm cloud sync`

APM loads the nearest applicable file.

## Sections

### `[spaces]` — Ignore Entire Spaces

Exclude whole spaces from cloud uploads:

```ini
[spaces]
private
temp
archive_*
```

Supports glob wildcards (`*` matches any characters).

### `[entries]` — Ignore Specific Entries

Exclude entries using `space:type:name` patterns:

```ini
[entries]
work:password:legacy_admin
*:notes:*draft*
personal:api_key:test_*
*:ssh_key:*
```

| Component | Description | Wildcard Support |
| :-------- | :---------- | :--------------- |
| `space`   | Space name  | `*` for any      |
| `type`    | Entry type  | `*` for any      |
| `name`    | Entry name  | `*` for any      |

!!! tip "Type Names"
    Use lowercase type identifiers: `password`, `totp`, `token`, `notes`, `api_key`, `ssh_key`, `ssh_config`, `wifi`, `gov_id`, `medical`, `travel`, `contact`, `cloud_creds`, `k8s`, `docker`, `cicd`, `recovery_codes`, `certificate`, `banking`, `document`, `software_license`, `legal`, `photo`, `audio`, `video`.

### `[cloud-specific-ignore]` — Provider-Specific Rules

Exclude entries only for a specific provider:

```ini
[cloud-specific-ignore]
dropbox:work:password:legacy_admin
github:*:ssh_key:*
gdrive:personal:notes:*journal*
```

Format: `provider:space:type:name`

Supported providers: `gdrive`, `github`, `dropbox`

### `[misc]` — Miscellaneous Flags

## Complete Example

```ini
# ============================================
# .apmignore — APM Cloud Upload Filter
# ============================================

# Spaces to never upload
[spaces]
private
temp_*

# Entries to exclude from all providers
[entries]
work:password:local_dev_db
*:notes:*scratch*
personal:ssh_key:id_ed25519_local

# Provider-specific exclusions
[cloud-specific-ignore]
dropbox:work:password:legacy_admin
github:*:document:*confidential*
```

---

## Pattern Matching Rules

- Patterns are **case-insensitive** for space and type matching
- Entry names are **case-sensitive**
- `*` matches zero or more characters (glob-style)
- Comments start with `#` and are ignored
- Inline comments after entries are supported (after `#`)
- Empty lines are skipped

## How Filtering Works

When you run `pm cloud sync`:

1. APM loads and parses `.apmignore`
2. A **filtered copy** of the vault is created in memory
3. Entries matching ignore rules are removed from the copy4. The filtered vault is encrypted and uploaded

!!! info "Local Vault Unaffected"
    Filtering only affects the **upload payload**. Your local vault file is never modified by `.apmignore`. All ignored entries remain safely stored locally.

---

## Debugging

To verify what your `.apmignore` is filtering, check the audit log after a sync:

```bash
pm audit
```

Sync events include details about which provider received the upload and how many entries were in the filtered payload.
